This directory is adopted from `kaldi/egs/swbd/s5c/local/pytorchnn`

Before runing the Pytorch-based NNLM rescoring, make sure 
1) all the steps in the `run.sh` have been executed properly.(It is a good practice to check 
    the files inside the `exp` dir).
2) config the parameters inside `local/pytorchnn/run_nnlm.sh` according to the generated data 
    in your exp(See the comments inside `local/pytorchnn/*.sh` to know how to set the related 
    parameters.).

Then, to run the Pytorch-based NNLM rescoring, one just simply type:
`bash local/pytorchnn/run_nnlm.sh`

If you encounter anything wrong, the first thing is to check whether some parameters are configured
properly(i.e. make sure the dir exists in your disk.). Otherwise, feel free to file an issue 
and we will fix it ASAP.
